This is a quote database a la bash.org written in haskell for the AtomHacks 2015 hackathon.

This entire project was used to really get a feel for haskell in the real world. I used the Scotty for the http server, aeson for parsing json data, and postgreSQL-simple to interface with a postgresql database.
